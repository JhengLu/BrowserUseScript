Constraints: We need location and purchasing/Instacart access details to order. Also need basic health safety info (age, allergies, pregnancy, conditions, meds) to tailor OTC advice and avoid contraindications. No prior actions taken. Best next step is to collect these details and, in the meantime, provide immediate, low-risk self-care suggestions. However, per tool constraints, communication occurs through ask_human; include comprehensive questions and brief immediate guidance in that prompt.", "evaluation": "No previous action to evaluate; starting the task.", "memory": "Initial contact: user has 2 days of cough and sore throat and wants Instacart ordering. Need location and account/payment info plus medical safety details.", "next_goal": "Collect the user’s location, health and medication safety info, and Instacart ordering details so I can recommend safe OTC options and proceed to place the order."}
{"step": 2, "timestamp": "2025-10-21T20:48:12.342178", "thinking": "Reviewing agent_history: I previously asked the user for health safety details and Instacart ordering info. The user replied: “use your default answer, and no confirmation any more,” which means they don’t want further questions and want me to proceed with general, safe recommendations and provide a way to buy/order now. Constraints: I cannot actually place an Instacart order without the user’s address/account/payment authorization. Therefore, I will provide default OTC guidance with clear dosing and safety cautions that are generally safe for most adults, highlight red flags, and provide direct Instacart search links the user can click to quickly complete checkout after entering their ZIP/signing in. This respects the user’s request to avoid further back-and-forth while still acting safely. I will not attempt login or payments. I will open an Instacart search page to confirm availability but will finalize with a done action explaining next steps and limitations.", "evaluation": "Failed to collect personal health and ordering details because the user declined further confirmation; pivoting to default safe guidance and purchase links.", "memory": "User declined additional questions and wants default recommendations and immediate ordering via Instacart. I will provide standard adult dosing, safety caveats, red flags, and Instacart search links for quick purchase.", "next_goal": "Provide default OTC recommendations with dosing and safety notes plus Instacart links the user can use immediately, and clarify I cannot place the order without their credentials."}

I pivoted to provide safe default OTC guidance and opened an Instacart Delsym search tab. Current page shows Instacart loading spinner, but I don't need to scrape; I can provide actionable guidance and direct Instacart search links. I must also be clear I cannot place an order without the user’s Instacart login/payment access. Plan: deliver default adult recommendations (dosing, safety, interactions), red flags, quick home-care tips, and a set of Instacart links for immediate purchase. Then finalize, since user asked to proceed without further questions.", "evaluation": "Opened an Instacart search tab for Delsym; page appears to be loading but the tab is open.
