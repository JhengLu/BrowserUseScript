The previous action sequence was to navigate to Hacker News and view the Show HN section, but we ended up on an unrelated GitHub page. This indicates that clicking on the first post in the Show HN section led us to this GitHub repository rather than showing post details within Hacker News. I should return to the Hacker News page and try accessing the post details again.

After multiple attempts, I'm still on the Hacker News homepage. The first post on the Show HN section is visible and appears to be the '8-bit CPU simulator' project. Since direct clicks aren't working, I need to try a different approach to view the post details without redirection.
